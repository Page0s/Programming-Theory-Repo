# Programming-Theory-Repo
Submission 2 for jr programmer pathway

successful submission will include:

- [x] Demonstration of inheritance (parent/child classes). Add a comment in the code that says “// INHERITANCE” to indicate where it was implemented. 
- [x] Demonstration of polymorphism (method overriding or overloading). Add a comment in the code that says “// POLYMORPHISM” to indicate where it was implemented.
- [x] Demonstration of encapsulation (getters and setters). Add a comment in the code that says “// ENCAPSULATION” to indicate where it was implemented.
- [x] Demonstration of abstraction (higher-level methods that abstract unnecessary details). Add a comment in the code that says “// ABSTRACTION” to indicate where it was implemented.


### PROJECT SUMMARY

While developing for every feature I was creating a new branch and when this feature was complete I would merge this new branch to the main.
The workflow was:

  - Create a new branch and switch to it
  - create necessary commits to the branch to complete feature
  - when the feature was complete switch to the main
  - then merge the finished feature branch to the main branch
  - push new changes to main on GitHub repo

I did not expect there will be no record about merged branches. All my commits look like they came from the main branch.
This issue can be avoided by pushing the new branch to the online repo and then when the feature from this branch is finished the pull request must be created to the main branch.

The correct way of "Git-Flow" workflow is:
  
  1. Create a new feature branch in my example "update-project-readme"
  2. Create/finish new feature with commit's
  3. Create pull-request for merging new branch to "main" <- "update-project-readme"
  4. Confirm merging
