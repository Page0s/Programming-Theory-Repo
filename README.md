# Programming-Theory-Repo
Submission 2 for jr programmer pathway

successful submission will include:

- [x] Demonstration of inheritance (parent/child classes). Add a comment in the code that says “// INHERITANCE” to indicate where it was implemented. 
- [x] Demonstration of polymorphism (method overriding or overloading). Add a comment in the code that says “// POLYMORPHISM” to indicate where it was implemented.
- [x] Demonstration of encapsulation (getters and setters). Add a comment in the code that says “// ENCAPSULATION” to indicate where it was implemented.
- [x] Demonstration of abstraction (higher-level methods that abstract unnecessary details). Add a comment in the code that says “// ABSTRACTION” to indicate where it was implemented.


### PROJECT SUMMARY

While developing for every frature I was creating new branch and when this feature was complete I would merge this new branch to main.
The workflow was:

  - Create new branch and switch to it
  - create nessesary commites to the branch to complete feature
  - when feature was complete switch to main
  - then mearge finished frature breanch to thr main branch
  - push new changes to main on gitHub repo

I did not expct there will be no record about merged branches. All my commites look like they came from main branch.
This issue can be avoided by pushing new branch to online repo and then when feature from this branch is finished the pull request must be created to main branch.
